# Quiet My Soul
## Psalm 62

[1](# "ref")
Truly my soul finds rest in God; <br>
my salvation comes from him.

Truly he is my rock and my salvation; <br>
he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.

[Psalm 62 (NIV) (p.1/6)](# "ref")

******
[3](# "ref")
How long will you assault me?<br>
Would all of you throw me down —<br>
this leaning wall, this tottering fence?

[4](# "ref")
Surely they intend to topple me<br>
from my lofty place;<br>
they take delight in lies.<br>
With their mouths they bless,<br>
but in their hearts they curse.

for God is our refuge.

Surely the lowborn are but a breath, <br>
the highborn are but a lie.<br>
If weighed on a balance, they are nothing;<br>
together they are only a breath.

Do not trust in extortion <br>
or put vain hope in stolen goods; <br>
though your riches increase,<br>
do not set your heart on them.

One thing God has spoken,<br>

according to what they have done.”
